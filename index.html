        <p class="lead mb-4">Laboratory of Meng Chen at UC Riverside - Laboratory Assistant. While being a laboratory assistant in Meng Chen's lab, I have obtained a lot of new techniques and knowledge on the world of laboratory science, especially in the realm of phytochrome signaling. In this lab, I perform laboratory tests including pre- and post-analytical phases such as PCR, gel electrophoresis, surface sterilazation, hypocotyl length determination, basta screening, and much more. I also collect and prepare 100+ samples/specimen daily to be test on, analyzed, and processed. For instance, by using programs to visualize data from gel electrophoresis, results can be obtained to show whether or not a plant is heterozygous or homozygous. This can then determine whether or not the plant has a specific allele that we are looking for. The goal for th elab is to elucidate signaling mechanisms by which light alters plant morphology and photosynthesis via dynamic reprogramming of nuclear and plastid genomes. My current responsibility is focused on the LRB-PHYB-PIF4 project. This project revolves around figuring out of LRB is linked and associated with phyB. Since phyB is a phytochrome, it can detect light and temperature. Essentiallu, with this detection, plants are able to grow better and taller. PhyB is known and discovered to be associated with pif4 which can detect temperature which in turn, can also stimulate better growth leading to taller plants. The goal to reach through this project is to see if irb is also associated and linked to phyB in terms of if temperature impacts plant growth as well by having irb.

        Urban Hydrology Fieldwork at UC Riverside - Research Assistant. While being a research assistant working alongside a PhD candidate, I was able to obtain a lot of experience in fieldwork. My main objective was to collect hydrological data from numerous urban sites to measure evapotranspiration to identify potential environmental and economical issues. To achieve this goal, I wworked alongside a PhD candidate to perform measurements for evapotranspiration by means of wind, soil moisture, air temperature, humidity, light, stomatal conductance, and soil sampling. This also included performing mapping techniques to precisely position irrigation cups for accurate measurements.<br><br>

        Red Cross Pasadena Youth Corps, Pasadena CA - Volunteer. Aside from laboratory work and fieldwork as a laboratory or reserach assistant, I have also volunteered with the Pasadena Red Cross Youth Corps. I have participated in “Sound the Alarm” events to help educate neighborhoods in fire safety protocols and install fire alarms in local homes. Through being a volunteer, I also obtained knowledge in basic first aid and participated in blood drives through assisting blood donors. Along with saving lives through blood donation and installing fire alarms, I have participated in putting on puppet shows for children in the public libraries and public events to showcase fire safety as well as other safety measures. Aside from volunteering, I also attended seminars and meetings to educate myself on basic first aid. Although I did not have any leadership experience during this volunteering experience, I plan to obtain even more volunteer experience with possible leadership positions by applying to volunteer at my local hospital.
